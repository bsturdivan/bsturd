      I write code for a fashion brand. It’s something I love—to converse with a
      computer and humanize it, to teach it to be approachable to my nephew, my
      parents, and everyone in between. But I am not only that. I design, make
      art and music, am a friend, but most importantly, a fellow human.

    </h4>
    <p class="body__copy">
      I started at Everlane in 2013 as the third software engineer. We were a
      small group of people tasked with helping design, program, and build
      everlane.com from the ground up. I then helped grow the technology team
      into the group we are today of 18 engineers, 3 designers, and 5 Product
      Managers. In my time at Everlane I have done everything from designing,
      front end programming, back end programming, site infrastructure, hiring,
      project management, mentorship and management, and engineer leveling. I’ve
      had my hands on every core page, API enpoint, automated email, and data
      pipeline.

    <p class="body__copy">
      At CBS I functioned as a software engineer for my first tech company.
      There I helped build the first CNET mobile site, building with NodeJs and
      an aggressive Redis caching system built on top of the CNET API. I later
      helped replatform the CBS News site onto the same platform we had built
      for CNET mobile.
