  'Just before our ship got lost you said "I am as constant as a northern star" And I said, "You\'re just as silly as a northern fish And if you want me I\'ll be in the bar" On the back of a cartoon coaster pad That didn\'t make me laugh at all I drew a map of Canada Oh, Canada And I charted our last squall',
  "The last time I saw Richard was Detroit in 68 And he told me all romantics meet the same fate Someday, cynical and drunk and boring someone In some dark cafe You laugh, he said you think you're immune Go look at eyes They're full of moon You like roses and kisses and pretty men to tell you All those pretty lies, pretty lies When you gonna realise they're only pretty lies Only pretty lies, just pretty lies",
  "He put a quarter in the wurlitzer, and he pushed Three buttons and the thing began to whirl And a barman came by in fishnet stockings and a bow tie And she said \"Drink up now it's getting on time to close\" Richard, you haven't really changed, I said It's just that now you're romanticising some pain that's in your head You've got tombs in your eyes, but the songs You punched are dreaming Listen, they sing of love so sweet, love so sweet When you gonna get yourself back on your feet? Oh and love can be so sweet, love so sweet",
  "Richard got married to a figure skater And he bought her a dish washer and a coffee percolator And he drinks at home now most night with the TV on And all the house lights left up bright I'm gonna blow this damn candle out I don't want nobody coming over to my table I've got nothing to talk to anybody about All good dreamers pass this way someday Hiding behind bottles in dark cafes Dark cafes Only a dark cocoon before I get my gorgeous wings and fly away Only a phase, these dark cafe days",
